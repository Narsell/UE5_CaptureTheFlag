# Capture the Flag
A demo game made in Unreal Engine 5 in an effort to learn more advanced techniques in UE5, mainly about the UMG. However a simple gameplay will be developed to feed the UI and make it work.

## Concepts and/or features worked on this project so far:

* UE5's C++ delegates (Non-dynamic, Multicast, and Dynamic)
* UMG Widgets with C++.
* Use of Game State, Player State, Game Mode.
* Others such as:
    * C++ Components.
    * Collision profiles, object types, etc...
    * Designed friendly componentes/actors.
